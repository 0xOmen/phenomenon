      <strong>Rules of Phenomenon </strong>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>For 3 to 9 players</div>
    <br />
    <strong
      >**Warning** This is a beta version of the game. The contract has a known
      issue that can be leveraged by savvy blockchain users to increase, but not
      guarantee, their chances of winning. Use at your own risk. Do NOT risk
      more than you can afford to lose.</strong

    <br />
    <div>
      Players register to become prophets. Once the game starts anyone that is
      not a prophet can buy tickets of the prophet they think will win. Anyone
      owning tickets of the last living prophets wins and can claim their share
      of the tokens in the pool.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      At the start of the game, one prophet is randomly selected to be the Chose
      One. The Chose One has divine powers and will never fail a miracle or
      smite attempt.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      No one knows who the Chose One is, not even the Chosen One. Players must
      deduce this through game play. **Warning - this beta version has a known
      cheat that can be exploited by savvy blockchain users. Use at your own
      risk**
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      When it is a prophet's turn they can do one of three actions: Perform a
      Miracle, Attempt to Smite, and Accuse of Blasphemy
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div><strong>Starting the Game</strong></div>
    <div>
      Once the appropriate number of players have signed up for the game, any
      player can hit the "Start Game" button.
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div><strong>Perform Miracle</strong></div>
    <div>
      The Chosen One will always succeed at performing a miracle. Other players
      have a 75% chance of success and the odds are improved based on how many
      followers they have (accolites + High Priests) compared to the other
      living prophets. However, if they fail they die. A successful miracle will
      free a jailed prophet. <br />Odds of Success = 75% + (ticketShare / 10)
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div><strong>Attempt to Smite</strong></div>
    <div>
      A successful smite eliminates the target opponent from the game. The
      Chosen One will always succeed at smiting an opponent. Other players have
      a baseline 10% chance of success. Chances of success go up based on the
      relative amount of followers a prophet has (accolites + High Priests)
      compared to the other living prophets. A failed Smite results in the
      prophet going to jail, or, if the prophet is already in jail, that prophet
      is executed and eliminated. <br />Odds of Success = 10% + (ticketShare /
      2)
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div><strong>Accuse of Blasphemy</strong></div>
    <div>
      A successful accusal has 2 outcomes. If the target opponent is free, then
      they are placed in jail. If the target opponent is already in jail, then
      they are executed and eliminated from the game. The Chosen One has no
      advantage with this action. Players start with a 10% chance of success and
      chances of success go up based on the % of followers a prophet has
      (accolites + High Priests) compared to the other living prophets. Failing
      an accusation results in the accuser going to jail. The opponent is freed
      from jail if they are in jail and the accusal fails. <br />Odds of Success
      = 10% + ticketShare
    </div>
    <br />
    <br /><br />
    <div><strong>High Priests</strong></div>
    <div>
      At the start of the game, some prophets may randomly be chosed to be High
      Priests. These players do not perform actions and cannot win the game on
      their own, however if they are a High Priest of the last remaining prophet
      then they win as well. Being a High Priest improves the odds of a prophet
      successfully performing an action. If the prophet that the High Priest is
      supporting dies then the High Priest is also eliminated. High Priests may
      change who they support at any time as long as they have not been
      eliminated. In the current version, living prophets can also change their
      allegiance up until only 2 players remain. A prophet that is alive at the
      end of the game but is not allegiant to themself is not eligible to claim
      winnings.
    </div>
    <br /><br />
    <div><strong>Tickets to Valhalla</strong></div>
    <div>
      Any wallet not registered as a prophet can become an accolite of one of
      the living prophets. Accolites can buy tickets of a Prophet on a bonding
      curve where price per ticket equals (ticketSupply^2) / 80. Buying tickets
      of a prophet improves that prophet's ability to perform actions. Accolites
      can sell their tickets on the bonding curve as well **This will incur a 5%
      fee taken by the protocol**. An accolite can change who they follow but
      first must sell all of the tickets of the prophet they currently follow.
      Once an accolite has sold all of their tickets they can choose a new
      prophet to follow. If the prophet an accolite is following dies then the
      accolite is eliminated and their tickets become worthless. If an accolite
      is following the winning prophet at the end of the game then they also win
      and can claim their share of the tokens at the end of the game.
    </div>
    <br /><br />
    <div><strong>Ending and Reseting Game</strong></div>
    <div>
      When only one prophet remains, the game is over. Anyone holding tickets of
      the last remaining prophet can claim their share of the tokens in the pot.
      The game must be reset before tokens are claimable. Ticket value is
      deteremined by the total amount of tokens deposited minus tokens withdrawn
      from sale of TicketsToValhalla divided by the number of tickets held by
      winners. **There is a 5% fee taken by the protocol on all funds** Reset
      the game with the desired number of players for the next round.
    </div>
    <br /><br />
    <div><strong>Claiming Tickets</strong></div>
    <div>
      Tickets can be claimed once the next game opens for registration. You need
      to remember the game number from which you want to claim your tickets. The
      current game number is displayed above the Prophets table. Enter the game
      number from the game you won to claim your tickets. <br />
      The value of a winning ticket = total tokens deposited / number of winning
      tickets.
    </div>
    <br /><br />
    <div><strong>Anti-Griefing - Force Turn</strong></div>
    <div>
      If after 3 minutes a player has not taken their turn, ANYONE may force
      them to perform a miracle by clicking the Force Miracle button.
    </div>
    <br /><br />
    <div><strong>Game Fee: Why and What For?</strong></div>
    <div>
      This is a beta version of Phenomenon. We hope to release a full featured
      version in the future but want to get feedback on game mechanics first. We
      need help building a better front end, getting an audit, and numerous
      other tasks that require funds to complete. We pledge that a majority
      (>50%) of the Game Fees will go to further developing the game. If further
      development isn't feasible then at least 75% of the funds will be donated
      to DegenDAO or similar Farcaster / Degen interest.
