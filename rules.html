      <strong>Rules of Phenomenon </strong>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>For 3 to 9 players</div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Players register to become prophets. The goal is to be the last prophet
      alive.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      One prophet is randomly selected to be the Chose One. The Chose One has
      divine powers and will never fail to perform a miracle or smite another
      player.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      No one knows who the Chose One is, not even the Chosen One. Players must
      deduce this through game play.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      When it is a prophet's turn they can do one of three actions: Perform
      Miracle, Attempt to Smite, and Accuse of Blasphemy
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div><strong>Starting the Game</strong></div>
    <div>
      Once the appropriate number of players have signed up for the game, any
      player can hit the "Start Game" button. After about 30 seconds a player
      will need to hit the "Set Game" button to sete the game in motion (this is
      to get around Chainlink Functions gass callback limit).
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div><strong>Perform Miracle</strong></div>
    <div>
      The Chosen One will always succeed at performing a miracle. Other players
      have a 75% chance of success. However, if they fail they die. A successful
      miracle will free a jailed prophet.
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div><strong>Attempt to Smite</strong></div>
    <div>
      A successful smite eliminates the target opponent from the game. The
      Chosen One will always succeed at smiting an opponent. Other players have
      a 10% chance of success. Chances of success go up based on the % of
      accolites following a prophet. There is no consequence for failing to
      smite an opponent.
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div><strong>Accuse of Blasphemy</strong></div>
    <div>
      A successful accusal has 2 outcomes. If the target opponent is free, then
      they are placed in jail. If the target opponent is already in jail, then
      they are executed and eliminated from the game. The Chosen One had no
      advantage with this action. Players start with a 10% chance of success and
      chances of success go up based on the % of accolites following a prophet.
      There is no consequence for failing to accuse an opponent. The opponent is
      freed from jail if they are in jail and the accusal fails.
    </div>
    <br />
    <br /><br />
    <div><strong>High Priests</strong></div>
    <div>
      At the start of the game, some prophets may randomly be chosed to be High
      Priests. These players cannot win the game on their own, however if they
      become the High Priest of the last remaining prophet then they win too.
      Being a High Priest improves the odds of a prophet successfully smiting an
      opponent or accusing them of Blasphemy. If the prophet that the High
      Priest is supporting dies then the High Priest is also eliminated. High
      Priests may change who they support at any time as long as they have not
      been eliminated.
    </div>
    <br /><br />
    <div><strong>Ending and Reseting Game</strong></div>
    <div>
      When only one prophet remains the winners can claim their share of the
      tokens in the pot. After everyone has claimed their tokens, reset the game
      with the desired number of players for the next round. Must wait 6 minutes
      to reset game. Tokens cannot be claimed once the game is reset!!!
    </div>
    <br /><br />
    <div><strong>Anti-Griefing - Force Turn</strong></div>
    <div>
      If after 3 minutes a player has not taken their turn ANYONE may force them
      to perform a miracle by clicking the Force Miracle button.
